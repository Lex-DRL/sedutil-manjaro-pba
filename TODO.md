# TODO

1. The current PBAs don't have their respective "rescue system" images... because after some tests I decided it would be much better to use **THE SAME** image as both the unlocking PBA and as a rescue system to set up another drive from. Technically, nothing stops us from having a second boot option with shell login, and dumping the same drive we've booted from into an image during setup process. But I haven't implemented it yet, since this project already consumed too much of my spare time.
2. Currently, a drive already flashed with these PBAs should work just fine. But the only way to set it up is doing it while booting from the official images. Or doing it under a live distro like Manjaro. However, you then have a trouble of **getting** `sedutil` binaries of a stable version (`1.20`). The easiest way to get them at the moment is just build a new PBA with a desired `sedutil` version: the actual executables are kept under `bld/mnt/SEDUTIL_BIN`. Use them explicitly during setup process (specify full path to `sedutil-cli` for every command, or just cd to `bld/mnt/SEDUTIL_BIN` and call `./sedutil-cli`).
3. Official setup process is extremely user-unfriendly. Adding a setup script would be very handy.
